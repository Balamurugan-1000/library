### The Plan
- There is a list of books in the library
- The books can be rented by normal users with user account 
- Librarian has to approve a book which rented if rejected the book will not be used by the user
- The user can return and the Librarian has to approve the book has returnned
- The number of books is limited so the book can be rented only in the certain limit at the time
